## About Java BMR Calcculator 

LOne popular way to estimateTrusted Source BMR is through the Harris-Benedict formula, which takes into account weight, height, age, and sex.

Females assigned at birth (FAABs)

BMR = 655 + (9.6 x weight in kg) + (1.8 x height in cm) – (4.7 x age in years)

Males assigned at birth (MAABs)

66 + (13.7 x weight in kg) + (5 x height in cm) – (6.8 x age in years)

Why you might want to know your BMR 
Your BMR can be used to help you gain, lose, or maintain your weight. By knowing how many calories you burn, you can know how many to consume. To put it simply:

Is your goal to maintain your weight? Consume the same number of calories that you burn.
Is your goal to gain weight? Consume more calories than you burn.
Is your goal to lose weight? Consume fewer calories than you burn.
That said, there are many factors that can influenceTrusted Source your weight. They include:

your level of physical activity
your sex
your age
any health conditions you have or medications you take
your metabolism
your gut microbiome
Counting calories by itself is not alwaysTrusted Source enough to lose weight. Many doctors today argue that what you eat matters much more.

For this reason, your BMR might not give you the full context you need to understand what lifestyle changes you can make to achieve weight loss.
